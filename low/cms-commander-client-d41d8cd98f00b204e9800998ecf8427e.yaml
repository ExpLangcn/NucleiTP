  name: "CMS Commander – Manage Multiple Sites Plugin <= 2.21 - PHP Object Injection"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The CMS Commander – Manage Multiple Sites plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and including, 2.21 via deserialization of untrusted input in the cmsc_authenticate() function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code."
