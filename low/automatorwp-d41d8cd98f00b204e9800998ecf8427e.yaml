info:
  name: "AutomatorWP <= 2.5.8 - Cross Site Request Forgery via bulk_delete"
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: "The AutomatorWP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the bulk_delete() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bulk delete CT objects via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
