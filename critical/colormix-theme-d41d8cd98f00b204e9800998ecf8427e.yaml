    Colormix (All Versions) - Multiple Vulnerabilities
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Colormix Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting, Content Spoofing, and Path Traversal in all versions. This is due to inclusion of a vulnerable version of JW Player. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts that execute in a victim's browser, create fake content, and read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
