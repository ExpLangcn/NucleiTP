  name: "Ready! Coming Soon <= 0.5.0 Stored Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Ready! Coming Soon plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.5.0. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Additionally unauthenticated attackers can perform actions in the plugin if they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
