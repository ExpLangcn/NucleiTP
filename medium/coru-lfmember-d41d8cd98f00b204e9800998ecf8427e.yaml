  name: "Coru LFMember <= 1.0.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Coru LFMember plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the /coru-lfmember-game-page.php function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete and activate arbitrary games via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
