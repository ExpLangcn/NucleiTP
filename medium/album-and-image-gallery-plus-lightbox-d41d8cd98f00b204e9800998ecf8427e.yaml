info:
  name: "Album and Image Gallery plus Lightbox <= 1.6.2 - Cross-Site Request Forgery"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Album and Image Gallery plus Lightbox plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on two of its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change attributes of images used by the plugin in slideshows, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
