info:
  name: "Custom Base Terms <= 1.0.2.3 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'base'"
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: "The Custom Base Terms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'base' parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled."
