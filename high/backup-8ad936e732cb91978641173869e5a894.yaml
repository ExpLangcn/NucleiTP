  name: "WordPress Backup and Migrate Plugin – Backup Guard < 1.0.3 - Arbitrary File Upload"
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The WordPress Backup and Migrate Plugin – Backup Guard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the backup_guard_get_import_backup() function in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible."
