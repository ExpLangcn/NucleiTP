  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: "The Backup Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in versions up to, and including, 1.2.8 via config and log files in the wp-content/backup-migration/ folder. This can allow unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data in certain configurations, including the site administrator's email address and the locations of site backups as well as the backups themselves."
